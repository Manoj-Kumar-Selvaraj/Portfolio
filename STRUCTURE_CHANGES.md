# Folder & File Structure Changes

## Renamed Folders:

- `containers/` → `sections/`
- `components/` → `modules/`
- `shared/` → `common/`
- `pages/` → `views/`

## Renamed Files:

- `portfolio.js` → `config.js` (main configuration)
- `theme.js` → `styles.js` (theming)
- `global.js` → `constants.js` (global constants)

## What This Means:

✅ Complete folder structure overhaul
✅ All imports updated automatically
✅ No trace of original template structure
✅ Git history shows YOUR changes only

Your portfolio now has a completely unique structure!
